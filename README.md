## All about N-Queens-Visualiser
- The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
- It works on backtracking.
- When we place a queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.
- This visualiser helps in understanding the algorithm in a very easy way.
